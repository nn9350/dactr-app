                <h2>Dactr — Explained Simply</h2>
                
                <h3>Imagine This...</h3>
                <p>You live in a small town in India. Your tooth hurts really badly. But the nearest good dentist is far away, you're not sure how much it'll cost, and honestly — you're a little scared. So you just... don't go.</p>
                
                <p>That's the reality for <span class="highlight">hundreds of millions of Indians.</span></p>
                
                <p>Now think about the dentist in that same small town. He's running his clinic with <span class="highlight">paper files, handwritten bills, and no way to remind patients about their appointments.</span> He's losing track of everything and has no idea which part of his clinic is actually doing well.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Dactr is trying to fix both these problems at the same time.</strong></p>

                <div class="stats">
                    <div class="stat-card">
                        <h4>9/10</h4>
                        <p>People in rural India have dental problems</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="stat-card">
                        <h4>4/10</h4>

                    </div>
                </div>

                <h3>So What Exactly Is Dactr?</h3>
                <p>You know how big restaurants use software to take orders, manage staff, and send you a receipt? <strong>Dactr does the same thing — but for dental clinics in small towns.</strong></p>
                
                <p>It's a <span class="highlight">software product</span> — part website, part mobile app — that helps dentists run their clinics smoothly, and helps patients like you and me actually take care of our teeth.</p>

                <h2>🖥️ For the Dentist — A Smart Dashboard</h2>
                
                <p>Think of this as a <strong>super smart digital assistant</strong> sitting on the dentist's computer. It helps them:</p>
                
                <div class="feature-box">
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Schedule appointments</strong> and automatically send WhatsApp reminders to patients so they don't forget to show up</li>
                        <li><strong>Create bills</strong> properly and quickly without doing it by hand</li>
                        <li><strong>Track supplies</strong> — like knowing when gloves, medicines, or tools are running low, so they never run out</li>
                        <li><strong>See reports</strong> that show how many patients came this month, which treatments are most popular, and how the clinic is growing</li>
                        <li><strong>Work even with slow or no internet</strong> — super important because rural areas often have terrible connectivity</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                
                <p>All the boring, time-consuming paperwork? Gone. The dentist can now <span class="highlight">focus on actually treating patients.</span></p>

                <h3>What Makes Dactr Different?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>✅ Affordable for small-town dentists</li>
                    <li>✅ Built for cities AND rural areas with slow internet</li>
                    <li>✅ Designed specifically for dental clinics — not generic</li>
                    <li>✅ Available in Hindi and English</li>
                    <li>✅ Works offline when needed</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div id="patient" class="page">
                <h2>📱 For the Patient — A Free Mobile App</h2>
                
                <p>This is like a <strong>personal dental health buddy on your phone.</strong> Patients can:</p>
                
                <div class="feature-box">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Take a photo of their teeth and get an <strong>AI-powered scan</strong> that can spot potential problems early — like a basic checkup from your phone camera</li>
                        <li><strong>Book appointments</strong> with just one tap instead of calling and waiting</li>
                        <li>See an <strong>estimated cost</strong> before visiting, so there are no surprise bills that scare people away</li>
                        <li>Read and watch <strong>tips about oral hygiene in Hindi</strong> — because not everyone is comfortable with English</li>
                        <li>Get <strong>basic emergency guidance</strong> even when there's no internet, like what to do if a tooth suddenly cracks</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h3>Why Is This Actually a Big Deal?</h3>
                <p>Here are some facts that might surprise you:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Nearly <span class="highlight">9 out of 10 people</span> in rural India have some kind of teeth or gum problem</li>
                    <li>But only <span class="highlight">4 out of 10</span> actually go to a dentist — because of fear, cost, or just not knowing where to go</li>
                    <li>The few dental software tools that exist are built for <strong>big cities like Mumbai or Delhi</strong> — they're expensive, complicated, and completely ignore small towns</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Nobody was building something specifically for rural India. Dactr is doing exactly that.</strong></p>
            </div>

            <div id="about" class="page">
                <h2>About Dactr</h2>
                
                <h3>Who Built It and Why?</h3>
                <p>A dentist named <strong>Nitin</strong>, who owns two dental clinics in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh, built this. He's been a dentist for over 15 years and was frustrated that no good software existed for clinics like his.</p>
                
                <p>So instead of waiting for someone else to fix it — <span class="highlight">he decided to build it himself.</span></p>
                
                <div class="feature-box">
                    <p><strong>That's actually a really big deal.</strong> He's not just some tech person guessing what dentists need. <span class="highlight">He IS the dentist. He knows the problem from the inside.</span></p>
                    
                    <p>It's like if a student who struggled with bad school canteen food decided to build an app to fix it — they'd know exactly what's wrong.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>The Bigger Picture 🌍</h3>
                <p>Dactr isn't just a cool tech product. It's trying to create real change:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>A dentist in a small town can now <strong>run a clinic as efficiently as one in Delhi</strong></li>
                    <li>A patient in a village can <strong>book an appointment, understand the cost, and feel less scared</strong> before walking in</li>
                    <li>Fewer people will need to travel to big cities just to get basic dental care</li>
                    <li>More people will start taking care of their teeth <strong>before</strong> small problems become big, expensive ones</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p class="quote">It's using technology to bridge the gap between cities and small towns — one dental clinic at a time. 💪</p>
