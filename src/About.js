      <h2>About Dactr</h2>
      <p>A dentist named <b>Nitin</b>, who owns two dental clinics in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh, built this. He's been a dentist for over 15 years and was frustrated that no good software existed for clinics like his. So instead of waiting for someone else to fix it — <b>he decided to build it himself.</b></p>
      <p>Dactr is built <b>from scratch</b> for small-town India — affordable, works offline, speaks Hindi, and is designed specifically for dental needs.</p>
      <p><i>It's using technology to bridge the gap between cities and small towns — one dental clinic at a time.</i></p>
