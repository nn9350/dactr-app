      <h1>Dactr — Explained Simply 🦷</h1>
      <p>Dactr is a smart digital helper for small-town dentists in India, and a friendly health app for their patients — making dental care easier, less scary, and available to everyone, not just people in big cities.</p>
      <h2>Imagine This...</h2>
      <p>You live in a small town in India. Your tooth hurts really badly. But the nearest good dentist is far away, you're not sure how much it'll cost, and honestly — you're a little scared. So you just... don't go.</p>
      <p>That's the reality for <b>hundreds of millions of Indians.</b></p>
      <p>Now think about the dentist in that same small town. He's running his clinic with <b>paper files, handwritten bills, and no way to remind patients about their appointments.</b> He's losing track of everything and has no idea which part of his clinic is actually doing well.</p>
      <p><b>Dactr is trying to fix both these problems at the same time.</b></p>
